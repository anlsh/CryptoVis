        <p>Number of ways a message can be enciphered: Theoretically infinite, around 10^77 on most modern systems</p>
        <p>Ease of encryption: High</p>

    <p>Diffie-Hellman can be considered one of the first sophisticated "mathematical encryption" algorithms.
        It is based not just upon scrambling of letters and redirection of output, but upon  one-way
        functions such as the natural logarithm. A function is generally said to be one-way if, given an output
    of the function, it is either infeasible or impossible to guess the input- these for functions are ideal for
    cryptography as, even if an encrypted message is intercepted, decoding it is extremely difficult.</p>
    <p>The Diffie-Hellman system is illustrated as follows, where the colors are analogous to extremely
    large prime numbers. The final mixture is a common key, which both parties use to encrypt further communications</p>

    <p>The crucial thing to notice of this algorithm is that Alice and Bob <b>never share their secret colors
    with each other.</b> At no point is that information ever broadcast. Thus, even if an eavesdropper intercepted the
        mixture during the public transfer, they would have to brute-force their way through an almost innumerably
    vast number of possible keys to determine the secret colors Alice and Bob used.</p>
