    <p>Quantum cryptography is a completely new cryptosystem which has only begun to emerge in recent decades. The
    appeal of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it is totally and completely uncrackable. Save for any radical
    changes to our current model of physics, no message sent through a quantum communication system can ever be
    deciphered by anyone but the intended recipient.</p>
    <p>The natural question to ask is, how? The answer lies in the fact that quantum cryptography relies neither on
    cipher alphabets, nor on one-way functions, but on the (extremely strange) properties of quantum particles such
    as photons. Quantum cryptography relies on a property of photons known as spin- any given photon has a horizontal
    spin (left or right), or a vertical spin (up or down). The spin of a photon can be manipulated and measured
    through the use of polarizers.</p>
    <p>If Alice and Bob wish to communicate with each other using a quantum cryptographic system, then the process
    is as follows.</p>
    <p>1. Alice sends Bob a stream of photons. Alice uses her polarizers to give subsets of photons a random spin in
        horizontal and vertical direction, and records what spin she gives these sets</p>
    <p>2. On the receiving end, Bob guesses which filters to use to measure each set of photons. If he uses the wrong
        filter (for instance, using a vertical filter to measure a horizontally polarized set of photons), then the
        photons will split into two groups, and Bob will realize he guessed wrong. If he guesses right, then Bob
    will measure the direction of the photon's spin along its axis accurately.</p>
    <p>3. After finishing the initial stream, Alice publicly transmits the set of axes each set of photons was
    polarized along (but not the direction in which the photons were polarized). Bob then publicly confirms to Alice
    which sets of photons he guessed correctly. The specific directions of the sets which Bob guessed correctly, which
    Alice and Bob never broadcast, form a secure key which the two can use to encrypt further communications.</p>
    <p>Suppose that Eve is attempting to listen in on Alice and Bob and intercepts a set of photons polarized
    horizontally. If she uses a horizontally polarized filter to measure them, then no harm, no foul. If, however,
    she guesses wrong and uses the vertical filter to measure them, then the photons will pass through with random spins
    along the y-axis. If Bob uses the horizontal filter to measure these intercepted photons (as he will about half
        the time), then he will assume that he guessed wrong. However during step 3, when Alice reveals that she
        polarized the intercepted set horizontally, Bob will instantly realize that the photons were altered along the
        way, and cut off communication with Alice. This is the second chief advantage of quantum cryptography- due to
        the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the very act of observing the message changes it
