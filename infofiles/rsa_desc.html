    <p>RSA is also based upon one-way functions, but differs significantly from the Diffie-Hellman system. The
    RSA system works as follows- each party on the internet has a public key and a private key. The public key is freely
    available to any other person upon request, whereas the private key must <b>never</b> be shared with anybody else.
    When one party wishes to send a secret message to the other, the sender looks up the recipient's public key and
    encrypts the message with it.</p>
    <p>Crucially, the encrypted message is infeasible for anyone (including the sender) to decipher without the
        recipient's private key. Therefore,
        the encrypted message may be sent freely, as the recipient is the only one who can decrypt it within a
        reasonable time.</p>
    <p>The RSA algorithm is the algorithm used to encrypt virtually all traffic on the internet today.</p>
