    <div class="image_subtext">Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman</div>
    <p>The RSA algorithm was first conceived of by Rivest after a night of heavy drinking with Shamir and Adleman.
        Rivest listed both, with whom he had researched cryptosystems for a number of years, on his paper describing
    the algorithm, and the algorithm would come to be named after the trio.</p>
